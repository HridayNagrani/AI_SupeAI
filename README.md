## Introduction
The  finical  security  investment  market  is  tradi-tionally  dominated  by  the  people  with  a  skillset  inquantitative  modelling  which  has  an  ultimate  goalfor  getting  the  best  prediction  of  future’s  price,  asthat  can  involve  a  high  level  of  automation,  dueto  advancement  into  technology  and  computationresources,  leveraging  machine  learning  for  quanti-tative  programming  become  the  hot  topic  in  themarket, also the real world finical data is very noisyand  non-stationary  which  make  this  pretty  hardand  also  the  security  price  provides  details  abouta very small part of the market which put us in thesituation  where  we  can  not  observe  actual  marketstates,  that’s  why  some  methods  of  quantitativemodelling  like  technical  analysis  with  dual  thruststrategy,  Machine  learning-based  approach,  deepneural network-based predictor and latest reinforce-ment learning-based approaches are in practice
